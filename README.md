# DocGenome: An Open Large-scale Scientific Document Benchmark for Training Next-generation Large Models

Scientific documents record research findings and valuable human knowledge, comprising a vast corpus of high-quality data. Thus, leveraging multi-modality data extracted from these documents and assessing large models' abilities to handle scientific document-oriented tasks is meaningful. Despite promising advancements, large models still perform poorly on multi-page scientific document extraction and understanding tasks, and their capacity to process within-document data formats such as charts and equations remains under-explored. To address these issues, we present DocGenome, a structured document dataset constructed by annotating 500K scientific documents from 153 disciplines in the arXiv open-access community, using our custom auto-labeling pipeline. DocGenome features four characteristics: 

- 1) Completeness: It is the first dataset to structure data from all modalities including 13 layout attributes along with their LaTeX source codes. 
- 2) Logicality: It provides 6 logical relationships between different entities within each scientific document. 
- 3) Diversity: It covers various document-oriented tasks, including document classification, visual grounding, document layout detection, document transformation, open-ended single-page QA and multi-page QA.  
- 4) Correctness: It undergoes rigorous quality control checks conducted by a specialized team. 

Besides, based on DocGenome, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of DocGenome and objectively evaluate the performance of current large models on our benchmark.

### Definition of relationships between component units
DocGenome contains 4 level relation types and 2 cite relation types, as shown in the following table:

| **Name**       | Description         | Example                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identical         | Two blocks share the same source code.                           | Cross-column text; Cross-page text.                                        |
| Title adjacen      | The two titles are adjacent.                                     | (\textbackslash section\{introduction\}, \textbackslash section\{method\}) |
| Subordinate        | One block is a subclass of another block.                        | (\textbackslash section\{introduction\}, paragraph within Introduction)    |
| Non-title adjacent  | The two text or equation blocks are adjacent.                    | (Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2)                                                 |
| Explicitly-referred | One block refers to another block via footnote, reference, etc.  | (As shown in \textbackslash ref\{Fig: 5\} ..., Figure 5)                   |
| Implicitly-referred | The caption block refers to the corresponding float environment. | (Table Caption 1, Table 1)           
</details>

### Attribute of component units
DocGenome has 13 attributes of component units, which can be categorized into two classes
- **1) Fixed-form units**, including Text, Title, Abstract, etc., which are characterized by sequential reading and hierarchical relationships readily discernible from the list obtained in Stage-two of the designed DocParser.
- **2) Floating-form units**, including Table, Figure, etc., which establish directional references to fixed-form units through commands like \ref and \label.

| **Index**  | **Category** | **Notes**                           |

## DocParser: A Cutting-edge Auto-labeling Pipeline
**Schematic of the designed DocParser pipeline for automated document annotation** The process is divided into four distinct stages: 
- 1) Data Preprocessing, 
- 2) Unit Segmentation, 
- 3) Attribute Assignment and Relation Retrieval, 
- 4) Color Rendering. 

DocParser can convert LaTeX source code of a complete document into annotations for component units with source-code, attributes, relationships and bounding box, as well as a rendered PNG of the entire document.
