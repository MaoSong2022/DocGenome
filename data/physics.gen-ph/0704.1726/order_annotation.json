In this field, a resonance usually is related to interaction and transfer of energy.

One can thus guess that at vanishing $T$, $T=0$, the quantum potential is converging toward a box of length $2L_0$ with perfectly flat bottom and an infinite wall at the boundary points, $q=\\pm L_0$. Let us show that our guess is correct. To do this, let us proceed to calculate the profile of the quantum probability density for vanishing $T$, $\\rho_0(q)$, assuming that $U_0(q)$ takes a box potential of length $2L_0$. Namely $U_0(q)=U_c$, where $U_c$ is constant for $-L_0<q<L_0$, and $U_0(\\pm L_0)=\\infty$. Since $U_0(q)$ is flat inside the support, then one has $\\bar{U}_0=\\int_{-L_0}^{L_0} dq\\rho_0(q)U_0(q)=U_c$. Hence, from the definition of quantum potential given in Eq.
