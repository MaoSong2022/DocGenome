A natural question then arises: when this quantization happens? To answer this question, one can borrow conventional idea from the physics of classical wave. In this field, a resonance usually is related to interaction and transfer of energy. We therefore expect that the quantization in soliton wave function happens if it  interacts with other physical object. We shall elaborate this idea as future work. "

Moreover, each particle is free to move independently from the other. Hence, we conclude that the Schr\\\"odinger equation of Eq.

One thus must consider both as a single particle of mass $m$ with energy $\\langle E\\rangle$. Yet, at sufficiently large time, the two solitons are spatially separated, thus no interference phenomena is seen.
